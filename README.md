# Radio Media Player for Home Assistant Lovelace ðŸ“»ðŸ•º

The Lovelace Radio Media Player view allows you to enjoy web radio using the [Mini Media Player custom card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player).

## Requirements

Use [HACS](https://github.com/hacs/integration) to install :
- [Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player)

## Use

The sample code uses two media_player named "**salon**" and "**sdb**". Feel free to you to rename them as you wish, but in this case replace **everywhere in all files** the ids of your media_player and input_select. 

You can also keep only one media_player or add a new one (be sure to duplicate the associated [automation](https://github.com/Bastiencc/radio-media-player/tree/master/config/automations) in this case).

You will find in the [assets](https://github.com/Bastiencc/radio-media-player/tree/master/assets) directory a sample file (.psd) in order to be able to add new images and radio.
